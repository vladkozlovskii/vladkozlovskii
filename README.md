### Hi there 
My name is Vlad Kozlovskiy  
I work in marine ecology since 2008. Among other tasks I processed data on certain ecological groups. Set of methods: biodiversity indexes, similarities indexes, dimensionality reduction methods: MDS, PCA. I am interested in any kind of data processing and machine learning in general. Also I am interested in GIS, spatial visualisation of data and computer vision. 

- Iâ€™m currently working on ecological modeling of marine fauna
- Iâ€™m currently working with few pet projects about computer vision
- Iâ€™m interested various aspects of machine learning and their mathematical basis
